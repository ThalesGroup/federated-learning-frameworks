# Federated Learning Frameworks

## Description

This repository contains tests made by Yasmine Chaouche during her intership at ThereSIS on different Federated Learning frameworks ([Flower](https://github.com/adap/flower), [NVFlare](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NVFlare/tree/main) and [EasyFL](https://github.com/EasyFL-AI/EasyFL)).


## Usage

Each folder is dedicated at one framework, then each sub-folder contains a specific use-case. The Flower and NvFlare frameworks are the ones that have been the more tested.

We recommend to start with NvFlare/nvflare_remote_fl and Flower/flower_with_containers as their readme explain how install and use the framework.
